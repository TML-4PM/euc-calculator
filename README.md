# EUC Job Pricing Calculator

This web application calculates job pricing for End‑User Computing (EUC) services. It supports both manual and email‑based inputs. The calculator groups products by category, allows quantity entry, and includes extra offers. The final quote is generated as a professional PDF (with Officeworks and Geeks2u logos) and can be exported as a CSV. It also integrates with a sample calendar for scheduling proposals.
