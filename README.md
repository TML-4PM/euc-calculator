EUC Job Pricing Calculator 🖥️💸
Overview
Welcome to the EUC Job Pricing Calculator , a powerful web application designed to simplify the process of calculating job pricing for End-User Computing (EUC) services. Whether you're an IT professional, a tech consultant, or just someone trying to figure out how much to charge for setting up a printer, this tool has got you covered.

This app allows you to:

Parse email requests to auto-fill forms.
Dynamically calculate pricing based on selected products and job variables.
Generate professional PDF quotes with company logos, ABN, contact details, and product lists.
Export aggregated data to CSV files for easy tracking.

Features
Here’s what makes this calculator the ultimate tool for EUC professionals:

1. Email Parsing: The Lazy Person’s Dream 📧
Don’t feel like typing? Just paste the client’s email into the form, and our magical parsing function will extract product names, quantities, and other relevant details automatically. It’s like having a personal assistant—without the awkward small talk.

2. Product Selection: Because Choices Are Hard 🛒
Choose from a comprehensive list of products and services, including laptops, monitors, keyboards, headsets, and more. Need a webcam? We’ve got it. Need a docking station? We’ve got that too. Need a unicorn-shaped mouse? Okay, we don’t have that—but we’re working on it.

3. Dynamic Calculations: Math Without Tears 🔢
No need to dust off your high school algebra textbook. Our app calculates total costs in real-time based on the products you select, urgency level, and whether the client wants you to work at midnight (spoiler: they do).

4. Export Options: PDFs and CSVs So Professional They’ll Cry 📄📊
Generate professional-looking PDF quotes complete with logos, ABNs, and contact details. Export all your quotes to a CSV file for easy tracking. Your accountant will thank you—or at least stop yelling at you.

5. Google Calendar Integration: Scheduling Made Easy 📅
Sync appointments directly to Google Calendar so you don’t forget to show up. Because nothing screams professionalism like being late to a job you’re charging $500/hour for.

6. Dark Mode: For When You’re Feeling Moody 🌑
Toggle between light and dark themes depending on your mood. Dark mode also helps when you’re pretending to work late at night but are actually watching cat videos.

Generate a PDF quote, send an email confirmation to troy.latter@unisys.com, and pat yourself on the back for being awesome.
Why This Project Exists
Let’s be honest: pricing jobs is hard. Do you charge by the hour? By the device? By how much coffee you drank while fixing the issue? This app takes the guesswork out of it, leaving you more time to sip lattes and pretend you know what you’re doing.

Special Note 🎉
This project was built through hard work, relentless learning, and caffeine-powered determination. The estimated $45K cost of development is currently waived, but donations in the form of coffee, good vibes, or tech partnerships are appreciated!
